Remove the icons associated with Timeline Express announcements.

== Description ==

Timeline Express - No Icons Add-On is a WordPress plugin that extends the base plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/timeline-express/">Timeline Express</a>.

The Timeline Express - No Icons Add-On removes the icons associated with the Timeline Express announcements. This add-on will remove the icon selection on the announcement new/edit screen, as well as the icons on the front end of the site.

When activated, the Timeline Express - No Icons Add-On will create a new settings tab on the Timeline Express settings page which will allow you to remove the icons globally, or explain how you can remove the icons on each timeline.

**Basic Usage**

Head into 'Timeline Express > Settings' and enable the 'Global No Icons' option to remove the icons on *all* timelines on your site.

If you want to remove the icons on a specific timeline, but leave them on others, you can add the 'no-icons' parameter to the <code>[timeline-express]</code> shortcode and set it to "1".

**Example**
<code>[timeline-express no-icons="1"]</code>
